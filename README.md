# "Me and You" startup specs
## Elevator Pitch
Communication is key in any relationship. Whether you just started a relationship or are in one right now, planning dates can be a stressful task; especially if you don't exactly know what you're partner is down to do. So instead of sending multiple text messages and memes and having each idea possibly shot down, how about you send them a list of options, and have them select the ones that they'd like? That's where I'd like to introduce Me and You. A couple's website where one person puts suggestions for dates and the other person receives those options and selects what they'd like to do. And the ones you agree on will then be displayed to show what you both are interested in doing!
