# "Me and You" startup specs
## Elevator Pitch
Communication is key in any relationship. Whether you just started a relationship or are in one right now, planning dates can be a stressful task; especially if you don't exactly know what you're partner is down to do. So instead of sending multiple text messages and memes and having each idea possibly shot down, how about you send them a list of options, and have them select the ones that they'd like? That's where I'd like to introduce Me and You. A couple's website where one person puts suggestions for dates and the other person receives those options and selects what they'd like to do. And the ones you agree on will then be displayed to show what you both are interested in doing!

## Key Features
- Authentication: The user will need to create an account and login. The user's name will be shown, below that name in smaller print will be their username they selected
- Database data: You can see what date other couples have agreed to go on to see what are some popular date ideas for inspiration
- WebSocket data: it will show some of the dates that have been agreed on that month
- Profile connection: users will be able to search the username of the person they've matched with online or met in person (if they have an account) and interact on a voting poll together
- Blind voting: Once connected, one person will create a poll and vote on it. The other person will not be able to see what the creator voted on. The other person will receive the poll that the creator chose and have a chance to vote. Those that they both voted on will display green after the receiver has voted.
